# password-strength-analyzer
Project Description: Password Strength Checker Objective: The Password Strength Checker is a Python-based tool designed to assess the strength of user-created passwords. The primary goal of this project is to help users understand and enhance the security of their passwords by evaluating them against a set of criteria that define a strong password.
Key Features:

Password Evaluation:
The tool checks passwords based on several criteria essential for robust security:

Length: Ensures the password meets a minimum length requirement.
Uppercase Letters: Verifies the presence of at least one uppercase letter.
Lowercase Letters: Confirms the inclusion of at least one lowercase letter.
Digits: Checks for the presence of numeric digits.
Special Characters: Ensures the password includes at least one special character (e.g., @, $, !).
Strength Classification:
Based on the evaluation criteria, the tool categorizes the password into one of three strength levels:

Strong: Meets all criteria and is considered secure.
Moderate: Meets most criteria but lacks one or more aspects of a strong password.
Weak: Fails to meet several criteria and is deemed insecure.
Feedback and Suggestions:
The tool provides actionable feedback to help users strengthen their passwords. Suggestions are given if the password does not meet all the required criteria, guiding users on how to improve their password strength.

How It Works:

Input:
The user is prompted to enter a password into the tool.

Evaluation Process:
The tool uses regular expressions (regex) to analyze the password against the predefined criteria. Each criterion (length, uppercase, lowercase, digits, special characters) is checked to determine if the password meets the security standards.

Strength Calculation:
Based on the number of criteria met, the password is classified as Strong, Moderate, or Weak. The tool then generates feedback and suggestions for improvement if necessary.

Output:
The password strength level is displayed along with any relevant suggestions for enhancing the password's security.

Benefits:

Enhanced Security: Helps users create stronger passwords to protect their accounts from unauthorized access and cyber threats.
Educational Tool: Provides insights into what constitutes a strong password and educates users on best practices for password creation.
User-Friendly: Offers clear and actionable feedback to users, making it easier for them to understand and implement password security measures.
Technical Details:

Programming Language: Python
Libraries Used: re (Regular Expressions) for pattern matching
Version Requirements: Python 3.x
Future Enhancements:

Integration with Password Breach APIs: Check if passwords have been compromised in known data breaches.
Graphical User Interface (GUI): Implement a user-friendly GUI using libraries like Tkinter to make the tool accessible to non-technical users.
Password Generation: Add functionality to generate strong passwords based on the defined criteria.
